# basic-star-wars-quiz-game
This program provides the user with 3 options.

In the first option, the user can end their experience and their total points will be tallied.

In the second option, up to 2 quizzes can be administered based on the user's response.

The user will either take the sith quiz or the jedi quiz first and then have the option to take the other quiz.

These quizzes will allow for you to bypass the second quiz or exit the loop.

Furthermore, the user's name only determines the order in which the user has to take the quizzes.

Additionally, the user will also be able to enter any part of the program that they want.

The third option will be very specific based on the user's name.

The user will take one short guessing quiz in which their points and attempts will be tracked.

The user can also access any portion of the game that they want.

Overall, there are 4 different quizzes, in which the order of the quiz is determined by your name.

After each question, you will be able to quit the game or go anywhere you want.

All quizzes loop so you can play the game an infinite amount of times.

Also, a random function is implemented in the third choice which you can access from anywhere in the game.
This random function will print a random jedi quote or fact.
Your points at the end of the game will be printed.
